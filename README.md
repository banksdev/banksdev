## Hi there 👋🏽 I'm Alexander! 

### Background
* MSc Computer Science (IT Security Specialization)
* IT Consultant @ Netlight 
* Co-Founder & Lead Developer @ Apexi

### What do I do? 🤔
I am currently working as a consultant for Netlight, solving our customer's problem with my awesome coding prowess 😎

### What am I passionate about? 🚀
I am a bit of a Flutter fanatic 😅 I believe (and hope) that it will change up the web development environemnt in the coming years!
By the way, check out my website 👉🏽 [banksdev](https://banksdev.dk) - it is built with Flutter 😎

My most comfortable programming language is C# due to the vast experience I have in the .NET world, but currently my favorite programming language is Rust.

I'm also super into _everything DevOps_ 👷🏼‍♂️ I am a big proponent of enabling work for developers with efficient CI/CD infrastructure! Finished features and fixes should get into production as quickly as possible to start generating value for the business and its stakeholders 💪🏽 

Recently, I have balso een getting into blockchains, and by extension crypto (currencies, NFTs, etc.), on a technical level. I am very interested in how it can solve real-world problems, and how the scalability and environmental issues (Proof-of-Work = 🙅🏽‍♂️) can be solved.

### What do I do offline?
I am a martial-arts practioner, and have been so for over a decade. 
I have primarily practiced Judo, (Japanese) Jujitsu and Muay Thai (Thaiboxing). 
Currently I am back to Jujitsu after a long break, in pursuit of my black belt! 🐱‍👤
