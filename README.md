## Hi there 👋🏽 I'm Alexander! 

### What do I do? 🤔
I'm currently finishing my master's degree in computer science with a speialization in IT Security! 

My thesis is on remote attestation of IoT devices in using Rust ⚡ 

### What am I learning? 📚
Recently I have been learning Rust for my thesis, but I have also been playing around with servless functions in Firebase, as well as Flutter for Web!


### What am I passionate about? 🚀
I am a bit of a Flutter fanatic 😅 I believe that it will revolutionize web development in the coming years! 
By the way, check out my website 👉🏽 [banksdev](https://banksdev.dk) - it is built with Flutter 😎

My most comfortable programming language is C# due to the vast experience I have in the .NET world, but currently my favorite programming language is Rust.

I'm also super into _everything DevOps_ 👷🏼‍♂️

Most recently, I have been getting into blockchains, and by extension crypto (currencies, NFTs, etc.), on a technical level. I am very interested in how it can solve real-world problems, and how the scalability and environmental issues (Proof-of-Work = 🙅🏽‍♂️) can be solved.

### What do I do offline?
I am a martial-arts practioner, and have been so for over a decade. 
I have primarily practiced Judo, (Japanese) Jujitsu and Muay Thai (Thaiboxing). Currently I am back to Jujitsu after a long break 🐱‍👤
